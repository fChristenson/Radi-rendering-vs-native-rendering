# Radi rendering vs native rendering

## What we will cover

* We will look at a few examples of rendering
* We will reason about the results

## Notes

Radi is yet another framework for making SPA style applications.

The project is very early stage at this moment and is selling
itself on being performant.

## Personal opinions

I hate this trend of performance, the idea that performance 
matters in an SPA is only true if you have a very heavy app.

Think about it this way, what does it matter if you have blazing
rendering speed if the rendering is faster than what the user
can perceive?

These are selling points that are as pointless as the top speed
of a car is to a normal person, what does it matter what the
top speed is if you are never allowed to use it?

I have only once felt that performance was an issue
and that was for a interactive seatmap made in React
with hundreds of thousands of nodes on a mobile device.

Trust me, the problem is not speed it is legacy code.
